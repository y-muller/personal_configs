## Alice 69 keys (Keychron)

#### Main layer

![main](../.img/layout_alice69_main.png)

Encoder moves the cursor word by word in most contexts and Control reverts to moving character by character.

The backtick is on `AltGr-Esc` (also on the Extend layer over the apostrophe). 

The alternate characters are configured in [XKB](../xkb/README.md).

#### Extend layer
Accessible with the EXTEND or EXT keys. Press LAYER LOCK to lock to this layer and again to exit it.

![extend](../.img/layout_alice69_extend.png)

Encoder controls the volume.

The arrow keys move the mouse cursor, or act as the scrollwheel with `Shift`. The mouse buttons are activated with `Alt`. 

#### Nav layer
Accessive with the NAV key. 

![nav](../.img/layout_alice69_nav.png)

Encoder controls the screen brightness and external monitor brightness with Shift.

Find next and previous work in several editors (F3 and Shift-F3). With Shift, switches to "Find in files" mode (F8 and Control-F8).   
Tab switching is with Control-Alt-PgUp/Dn and works is several editors and can be configured in gnome-terminal and others.  
Dynamic macros 1 and 2 are recorded in the System layer.  
Application shortcuts work with the [run-or-raise](../run-or-raise/README.md) Gnome extension.  

#### System layer
Accessible by activating both the Extend and Nav layers at the same time.

![system](../.img/layout_alice69_system.png)

Encoder control the brightness of the RGB effects or with `Shift` the brightness of the indicators. The encoder button toggles the RGB effects while keeping the indicators.

RGB defaults returns to the rainbow effect and 100% brightness.
